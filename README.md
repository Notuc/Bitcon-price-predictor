Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that has gained significant popularity in recent years. As with any other financial instrument, Bitcoin's price is determined by market supply and demand dynamics, which are influenced by various factors such as news, sentiment, regulations, adoption, and more. Predicting Bitcoin's price accurately is challenging due to its high volatility and non-linear behavior, making it an exciting area for machine learning applications.

Project Goals:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the future price movements of Bitcoin. The model should take into account various relevant features such as historical price data, trading volume, sentiment analysis of news articles, and social media activity related to Bitcoin, among others. Additionally, the model should be able to adapt to changes in market conditions and provide real-time predictions.

Methodology:
The project will involve the following steps:

    Data Collection: Historical price data, trading volume, and news articles related to Bitcoin will be collected from various sources, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, financial news websites, and social media platforms.

    Data Preprocessing: The collected data will be preprocessed and cleaned to remove any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers. Additionally, features will be extracted from the data to feed into the machine learning model.

    Model Selection: Several machine learning algorithms will be tested, including regression models, NBeats, LSTM,time-series models, and deep learning models, to identify the best-performing model. 

    Model Training: The selected model will be trained using historical data, and its performance will be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared.

    Model Testing and Validation: The trained model will be tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its generalization performance. The model's performance will also be compared to other baseline models and evaluated using backtesting techniques.

    Real-Time Prediction: The final model will be integrated into a web application that can provide real-time predictions of Bitcoin prices based on the latest data available.

Conclusion:
The proposed project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict Bitcoin's price movements using various relevant features. The project's outcome will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the Bitcoin market and may help investors make informed decisions.
